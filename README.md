# Cryptography and Network Security

#### FESB, 2024/25

By solving crypto lab challenges, you will gain hands-on experience in data protection using cryptographic mechanisms. The labs consist of a series of interconnected **capture-the-flag (CTF)**-style challenges, where solving each task unlocks a flag required to access the next lab. Each flag follows the format `crypto{th1s_is_y0ur_f1ag}` for easy recognition.  

Ultimately, you will demonstrate possession of a single **final** flag to earn full credit for the labs.
